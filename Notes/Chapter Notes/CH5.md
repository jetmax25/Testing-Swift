# Chapter 5 - Test Driven Development

## Laws
1. Can only write production code that makes a failing unit test pass
2. Can not write any more of the unit test than is sufficient to fail
3. Can not write any production code more than is sufficient to pass

## Best Practices 

1. Red - Create failing test
1. Green - Create production code to pass test
1. Refactor - Clean up code

If a test passes before changing production code there is an issue

Behavior-driven developement - varient of TDD that focuses on a standardized language that describes the test from the perspective of user stories
